# Delivery Guide
 
The Delivery Guide takes a high level view of the overall process of delivering a machine learning solution, going from the initial customer conversation, envisioning sessions, architecture design sessions (requirements gathering and clarification, whiteboarding), PoC/Pilot delivery, operationalization and post-deployment considerations. This guide is about 10-15 pages in length and includes supporting checklists and templates to help you get started quickly and stay organize throughout project delivery.
