# PoC v.s. Pilot for Machine Learning projects

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

Machine learning projects include significant risks – for example, the data required may not be available or the problem may not lend itself to accurate prediction. Reduce the risk of overpromising on machine learning capabilities by conducting a focused proof of concept that enables you to de-risk the riskiest elements of the larger machine learning solution, build trust with the customer and deliver working machine learning solutions in a shorter timeline. 

### Why Perform a Proof of Concept for machine learning?

Proof of concepts (PoC) serve several purposes. When it comes to the machine learning, a primary aim of the PoC is to substantiate that a machine learning solution can actually deliver on the vision capture during the envisioning session. The intent is to avoid skepticism on the part of client about the capabilities that can be realized and to detect situations over-promising on the capabilities of machine learning before any significant investment occurs. 

The PoC also can serve as evidence that your practice can use for future engagements with the same customer or with new customers. Many times, the output of a PoC can be added to your practice’s intellectual property list for demonstrations or used to accelerate future solutions. PoCs are one of the key tools when trying to displace the competition by rapidly showing value and hopefully a quick return on investment.

### Define PoC Scope

A proper PoC is defined with a clear and concrete scope. Conduct an envisioning session or an architecture design session (ADS) to align business and technical requirements and set clear goals. This should include:
- Identify the machine learning workloads and features to demonstrate. Specifically identify and prioritize the aspects that are high risk.
- Identify the data that will be used to train any underlying machine learning models.
- Determine what you want to prove and which objections need to be overcome.
- Clearly demarcate responsibilities and set up organization.
- Set up subscriptions, define payment, and perform cost estimates of the PoC.
- Agree on the next step if success criteria are met.

### Delivering a PoC

Identify the technical resources needed for the PoC. This will include the technical implementation team (including developers and data scientists), as well as project management for tracking the progress of the engagement. 

Beyond identification of resources, ensure all members of your team and your customer’s technical team (if they are participating) are clear on responsibilities. Communication is critical, so ensure that the progress of the PoC is communicated to all stakeholders on a regular basis.   

During the PoC execution, keep a watchful eye towards scope creep. The PoC should be hyper-focused on proving that a machine learning solution can be delivered as envisioned by addressing only the core concerns originally identified during the scope definition. For example, most machine learning PoCs will want to attempt the solution first with a simple, parsimonious model, before going down the path of building out a more complex model. Avoiding the temptation to start with the more complex solution is a good strategy for keeping the minimalist scope required of a PoC.

### After the PoC

At the end of the PoC, create a report that explains the overall status of the PoC and any issues identified during the PoC. The report should elaborate on the pros and cons of the delivery and clearly explain the value prop of moving forward with a real implementation to the stakeholders along with expected production costs over time. Assuming the stakeholders agree to move forward, put a plan into place to deploy the PoC into production while ensuring that the PoC is designed for production usage.

For example, upon completing your machine learning PoC you might report on the success or failure of utilizing a transfer learning, the quality and predictive strength of the customer supplied data used, or the feasibility of realizing the customer’s vision.

## Deliver a Pilot for a Machine Learning project

A PoC might secure the project, but a pilot is what you will deliberately take to production.

Consider offering your services as a pilot project to your prospects. With a pilot project, the customer receives two important values. First, they get to better understand how the project goals will be successful, and second, they have a production-grade starting point for their larger efforts.

Another value of a pilot is it serves as a way for your implementation team (developers and data scientists) to stretch into new areas (learning the customer’s domain, learning to apply different predictive algorithms, working with unfamiliar data), while minimizing risk if something doesn’t work out quite right on the first attempt. This is because while the intent of a pilot is to ultimately take the solution into production, the initial pilot delivery is never rolled out directly into production, at best it usually affects a subset of the production environment which helps to minimize the impact of unexpected issues. 

### Delivering a Pilot

Start the pilot design process with a clear plan on its initial scale, and develop a strategy to increase its scale as milestones are met. 
For instance, if the intent of the pilot is to onboard a small portion of the customer base at first, identify the participants early and add your communication strategy to the project plan. Consider targeting users who are representative of the whole of your customer base. This should provide you with an accurate test of geographic, technological, and demographic factors.

### Phases of the Pilot

- Define scope – typically occurs during an architecture design session (ADS)
- Execute implementation – create, test, refine, repeat
- Conclude – post-mortem, validation, path to production plan

### Conducting the Pilot

The following checklist provides the core tasks you should complete when conducting a pilot.
- Go over established business and technical requirements from the detailed requirements gathering session (e.g., architecture design session)
- Determine which features will be included in the pilot that provide a minimum viable product
- Conduct a full-fledged design, mapping requirements to workloads and features of the pilot
- Establish team responsibilities and organization
- Perform cost estimates (e.g., for Azure services used like Cognitive Services, Machine Learning, etc.)
- Outline next steps after the success criteria is met

### After the Pilot

Throughout the pilot, you have collected valuable data from metrics and telemetry, and have compiled user feedback and taken this information to refine the pilot and prioritize features for general release. The next step is to propose the move to production and provide a cost estimate and delivery schedule to the customer. You should perform the following in concluding a pilot:
- Learn to identify the end of the pilot; when the proposed features are functional and validated, and when the business transformation begins
- Conduct a post-mortem of the pilot, talking to users, business managers, developers, and development managers. Evaluate lessons learned and refine feature list to include any features excluded from the pilot
- Upon agreeing to move to production phase, establish cost and delivery schedule based on established plan to transform to v1 product
