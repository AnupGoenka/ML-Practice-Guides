# Platforms, services, and tools

Having a clear understanding of the platforms, services, and tools that are available is a key ingredient in running a successful PoC/Pilot Machine Learning project.

While there are [significant differences](../1-poc-vs-pilot/README.md) between a PoC and a Pilot Machine Learning project, always keep in mind their most important common goal - gaining the trust of the customer that:

1. The problem can be effectively solved using Machine Learning
2. You and your team do have the necessary skills and knowledge to solve the problem

In the quest to gain customer trust you must be able to prove and/or showcase various aspects like sizing, performance, availability, scalability, security, explainability, maintainability, extensiblity, and cost estimation. Not all projects will challenge you in all aspects but its reasonable to expect that each project will require you to deal with a non-trivial combination of them.

This section covers the following topics:

- [Overview of platforms, services, and tools](overview.md)
- [Sizing and performance](sizing-performance.md)
- [Availability and scalability](availability-scalability.md)
- [Security and explainability](security-explainability.md)
- [Maintainability and extensibility](maintainability-extensibility.md)
- [Cost](cost.md)
