# Driving customer engagement during and past PoC/Pilot

The following aspects are relevant to driving customer engagement in general:

- Ensure the PoC/Pilot project refers to aspects of a real business pain, that has been validated and confirmed with the proper decision making level in the customer organization
- Identify at least one business stakeholder in the customer organization - avoid projects that have exclusively technical stakeholders
- Identify early in the project real and confirmed/validated customer concerns related to sizing, performance, availability, scalability, security, explainability, maintainability, extensiblity, and cost estimation - these are critical issues to address 

## Driving engagement during a PoC project

- Limit the scope of the project to a few aspects to prove your point, and keep focusing on them
- Keep in mind that even if it's a PoC, it must prove a useful business result can be achieved - PoCs that only prove technical points of view tend to be less valued by customers
- Initiate discussions about a potential continuation and start exploring the scenario as early as possible during the delivery of the PoC project

## Driving engagement past a PoC project

- Use PoC results to drive commitment for either a Pilot or a Full project

## During engagement during a Pilot project

- Explain every stage of the Pilot
- Help the customer understand how the business pain is solved and how can this be measured/proven
- Start shaping and scoping the full project as early as possible during the delivery of the Pilot project
- Ensure the customer starts to use the results of the project as early as possible in its business processes 
- Help the customer identify effective ways to validate the results of the project

## Driving engagement past a Pilot project

- Use Pilot results to drive commitment for a Full project
- Showcase Pilot project results to help your customer champions
