# Identifying clear and compelling scenarios for continuation

The following aspects are relevant in identifying scenarios for project continuation:

- Cross-sell the result of the PoC/Pilot project (e.g. identify other business units/departments from the customer organization which could be interested in similar approaches)
- Up-sell the result by generalizing the problem addressed by the PoC / Pilot project and providing a proposed approach to solve the more complex problem (keep in mind to still fit within an existing business pain)
- Always work with business pains, not hype or pure technical interest
- Use the opportunity of the PoC/Pilot project to learn about other business pains that are addressable with machine learning
- For each business pain that can be addressed potentially with machine learning, identify the right business decision maker and make sure the person fully understands what can be achieved, which are the advantages and how can the results be measured in business-compatible metrics
