# PoC & Pilot Guide
 
The PoC and Pilot Guide is a comprehensive and authoritative process-centric guide for planning, designing and executing machine learning PoCâ€™s and pilots in Azure and utilizing Azure Machine Learning. This guide covers the important topics to know before talking to the customer (inclusive of topics around performance, availability, scalability, security, maintainability, extensibility, cost, tools and key services). The guide is about 10-15 pages in length.
 
Templates and checklists are provided for each phase of the PoC or pilot delivery, centered around specific machine learning horizontal scenarios (computer vision, text analytics and NLP, recommendation, forecasting, anomaly detection, classification and regression and reinforcement learning).
